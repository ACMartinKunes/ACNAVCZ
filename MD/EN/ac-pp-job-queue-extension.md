Task queue module allows you to run reports or automated procedures in Microsoft Dynamics NAV at scheduled intervals. It is used mainly for automated periodic reporting, and allows you to send the final report as an attachment to an e-mail in HTML format, save them, or publish it to SharePoint. In particular, managers have available current results or reports in place, without having to manually generate a report every time. Another possible use is regular unattended execution of batch jobs, such as adjustment or post inventory cost.
The extension of the job queue is a complementary module to define the parameters of the job and the actions carried out in the boot, the success or failure of the completion of tasks such as sending notification email.
