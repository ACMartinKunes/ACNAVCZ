# <a name = "ac-pp-job-queue-extension.md" > </a> Job Queue Extension

Job Queue module allows you to run reports or automated procedures in Microsoft Dynamics NAV at scheduled intervals. It is used mainly for automated periodic reporting, and allows you to send the final report as an attachment to an e-mail in HTML format, save them, or publish it to SharePoint. In particular, managers have available current results or reports in place, without having to manually generate a report every time. Another possible use is regular unattended execution of batch jobs, such as adjustment or post inventory cost.

**Job Queue Extension** is a complementary module to define the parameters of the job and the actions (eg notification email) carried out at the start, in case of success or failure of the task completion.
