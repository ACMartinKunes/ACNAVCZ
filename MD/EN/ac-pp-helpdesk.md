Add-on module help desk extends the capabilities of Microsoft Dynamics NAV for the centralized registration, management, and evaluation requirements. The requirements may be any internal or external stimuli to which the company needs in a controlled manner to respond and deal with it, for example. external service requests, orders, support and intervention, internal service requests, requests, wishes and problems, etc.. The module supports the complete workflow to handle requests from a request, through the assignment of responsibilities, a record of the course of the processing of requests to specify how to resolve and close the request. For greater convenience, you can use when specifying requirements to include up to 3-tier hierarchical classification.
