# General Descriptions

General descriptions both extend the standard texts that are used in the system, for example. in the invoice lines, and here you can define any general texts that can then be used for various pur-poses, such as. the text in the subject line of the e-mail, the text in the body of the email salutati-on. 
General descriptions may or may not be related to a specific table. Fields from a table can then be used in the syntax of the text. The text so the user can stack them from:
-	custom text
-	field values
-	the name of the field (the field caption)
-	from the system of values (work date, the current datem, the current time)
-	registered functions, if any function for the table.
Formula text may then look for example. as follows: customer% 1% 2% 3 (% 4), where the percen-tage and the number representing the defined parameters. For the formula of the text it is pos-sible to define translations in different languages. If it is used in the formula, type = caption box, his translation is dependent on the implemented object language packs.
Using the Test action is possible for selected record check form as text.
