# <a name="ac-pm-sales-invoicing"></a>Sales Invoicing

To create sales invoices from consignments, you use the consignment billing counter. It allows generating issued invoices with pre-set accompanying texts based on predefined settings. From the consignment invoicing console, it is possible to directly edit the billing lines of the shipment, generate lines of a sales credit note, or modify billing documents in any way before they are included in the invoice. The counter allows custom invoices to be processed in individual consignment mode, but also generates bulk invoices into which shipments are accumulated based on the tax period, currency, or other criteria that users can choose to use through filters. The billing invoice consignment has the option to retrieve consignments based on the shipping number that was carried out.

Using the pre-consistency and consignment billing console, it is also possible to perform an "internal invoicing" operation between the entity that ordered the service and the realization.

Billing line items contain information about both the invoice they have been prepared to include, but also information about the final invoice number or, credit note. Charging the sales invoice containing line items associated with the shipment will update the billing status of the shipment.
