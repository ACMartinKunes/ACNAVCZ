# <a name="ac-pm-routing-itinerary"></a>Routing Itinerary

An itinerary is a route between the starting and destination geographic point or between the distribution points with the possibility of inserting transit points. The itinerary can also take into account the experience of dispatchers, drivers and other features that can not be accurately calculated.

Itineraries are based manually. The system offers many support functions for managing itineraries, such as planning, viewing or comparing a route, copy itineraries, creating reverse routes, or listing variants.

If you use map & guide map integration, you can generate routes automatically, including the route charging information provided by Map&Guide.

You can work with displaying constraints, geographic points registered in the system, or position of the vehicles in map view.
