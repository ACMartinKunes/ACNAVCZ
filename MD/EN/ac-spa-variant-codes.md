For each eat you can specify the default variant recipe depending on the spa house, local eateries, a type of eating, eating a diet, age category and specify the priority of these dependencies. In the case that when you create a daily diet of variant recipes is not intended, or the selected option, the default option is selected for the food with the highest priority that corresponds to a given combination.
