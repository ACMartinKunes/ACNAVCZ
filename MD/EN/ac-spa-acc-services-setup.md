# Accommodation Services Setup

This code list is used for automatically finding and assigning accommodation services for a bed, an extra bed and unoccupied bedthat are dependent on the category of accommodation, type of stay and age category. 
The link between the pumped and charged service may not always refer to the binding of one to one. For example. provide better accommodation categories means one in terms of service, but can be divided into two services posted (base + surcharge). Each service can then pay the same or even ano-ther payer.
For these reasons, it is necessary to define for the property and have the possibility for different pur-poses to assign several services:
-	Bed-allows you to define a basic service for bed
-	Surcharge– Bed – allows you to define a service surcharge for cot
-	Unoccupied bed – allows you to define a basic service for unoccupied bed in case when the client asks the cast of an entire room
-	Surcharge– Unoccupied bed – allows you to define a service surcharge for unoccupied bed in case when the client asks the cast of an entire room
-	Client blocked bed – allows you to define a basic service for the room in the case when the client is outside of the spa facilities, for example. because of hospitalization
-	Supplement – Client blocked bed — allows you to define a service surcharge for room in the case when the client is outside of the spa facilities, for example. because of hospitalization
-	Surcharge– Early arrival (allows you to define service extra charge for early check-in, which they do not occupy the accommodation capacity)
-	Surcharge– Booked early check-in (allows you to define a service surcharge for early check-in, occupying the accommodation capacity)
-	Surcharge – late departure (allows you to define a service surcharge for late check out, that they do not occupy the accommodation capacity)
-	Surcharge– Booked late check-out (allows you to define a service surcharge for late check out, that occupying the accommodation capacity to the standard early the following day)
-	The whole room (this field allows you to specify the service to account for the entire room to one client, other clients in the same room it will be free)
-	Surcharge– The entire room (this field allows you to specify the service for billing surcharge of a category in the case of price for the whole room)
-	The code list also allows you to define the services on the same principle also for extra beds and guide
