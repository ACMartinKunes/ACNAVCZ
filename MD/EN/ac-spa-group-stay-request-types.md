# Group Stay Request Types

In one group, and one of the rooms can be accommodated clients several types of stays. This is the form of the stay request types that can be viewed from the requirements of the group. The form is automatically determined by the first line with the total expected number of visits and the type of client and the stay of the group header. The user can establish additional rows with other types of client and residence, and to define for them a value in the "expected number of stays". This automatically recalculates the value of the field in the first row.
