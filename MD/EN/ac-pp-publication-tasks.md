The Publication Tasks module is the extension of SharePoint Publishing module. It extends the capabilities of publishing at two levels:

* Basic publishing of tasks and their attributes
* Tasks publishing based on the advanced settings through the Publishing Templates (requires the Publication templates module).

Allows you to publish tasks to the SharePoint system directly from the Microsoft Dynamics NAV, link them with records in the tables of information system and add user-defined attributes (metadata).
