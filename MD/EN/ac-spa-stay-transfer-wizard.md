# Stay Transfer Wizard

If the client decides to change type during the stay of the stay, this system allows you to use "The conversion wizard in residence"where the user fills in only by changing the properties of the stay. By converting the original stay truncates to the date specified in the Change of the date and a new stay with changed Receive status information. Both visits will be tied across the field number of the source of the stay and the number of the continuation of the stay on the stay of the client, the status of the original residence is changed to converted.
