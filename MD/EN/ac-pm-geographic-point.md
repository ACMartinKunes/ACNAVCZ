Prepresents the location on the map, which is identified by the address (State, city, zip code, Street.). Thanks plink to file documents with the map Map & Guide You can view directly on NAV on map the location of that point and his clarification. It is also possible to perform

- „Geocoding" when according to the the specified address System NALezNo position (coordinates) 

or

- „Reverse geocoding" when according to determine the location on the map to get the system finds a match the address.

The geographic point can be, for example, a car park, a place of clearance, a place of overpass, a petrol station, a junction, a motorway exit, etc.

The NAV contains support tools for finding existing locations in the inventory (to minimize duplication) or setting them up if a given point is not found according to refinement criteria.

In order to increase the clarity of Geographic Point Recordings, the system allows you to define geographic point naming masks according to the set rules (eg Country / City / Street).
