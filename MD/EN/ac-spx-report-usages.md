# Report Usages

The use of the report contains the specification of the manner in which the report will be run in diffe-rent situations. Allows you to define the number of relational tables for custom report layout (the appearance of the report), as well as "relational table/field Numbers language" and the language in which the report will be printed or the "number of relational tables/pole email "from which it finds the email address to which the report will be sent to you. In this setting, it is still possible to define the way in which the subject text of the message is created for sending email, or what file name will have an attached file in an e-mail attachment.
