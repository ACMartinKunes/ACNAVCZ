Add-on module Registration of tools and aids examines the evidence of tools, aids, utilities, molds and other needs usually registered by using the inventory system. This module is based on Fixed Asset, with a view to the unification of the registration for the purposes of tracking fixed assets and production registration, ie. lending tools and gadgets.
