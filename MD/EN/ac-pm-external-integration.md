# <a name="ac-pm-external-integration"></a>External session integration

It is a general tool that allows you to refer to fleets, drivers, commodities, or businesses at the distribution site by alternative codes for different communication sources. An example may be an external software that manages tracking units of a vehicle that records them with a different sign than they are recorded in the NAV. The external integration session thus serves as a bridge between external sources and NAV.
