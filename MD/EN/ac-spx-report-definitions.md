# Report Type 

This module extends the definition of print reports and is used, for example, to print a report when you post different Spa vouchers or to print reports that have a fixed destination, i.e.. are printed on the page through a specific button.
In the report it is possible to define a method to obtain a custom layout for the report, the language in which the report will be translated or e-mail addresses to send the report by e-mail.
