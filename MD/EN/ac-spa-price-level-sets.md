# Price Service Sets

A set of services for valuation is used to define the link between the pumped and charged service which may not always refer to the binding of one to one. E.g. healing as a package, in terms of operational management may consist of several treatments, but in terms of posting and then i the award represents one posted Service (daily rate). Or vice versa the provision of better diet means a single service from the perspective of operation, but can be divided into two services posted (base + surcharge). Each service can then pay the same or even another payer.
