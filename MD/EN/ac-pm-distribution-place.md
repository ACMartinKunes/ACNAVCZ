# <a name="ac-pm-distribution-place"></a>Distribution place

To register the place where the loading or unloading of the transported commodity can be carried out, the distribution list and companies' distribution list is used. Each Distribution Point is associated with a geographical point, that is, one specific address and the coordinates of a given location.

Each Distribution Point (DP) may contain one or more companies that can be served at a given location. If DP includes more than one company, it is a representative of an area where multiple subscribers or suppliers are registered. For a DP business, you can record a contact number or other registration data relating in particular to the maximum length, width and height of the car, the loading and unloading times and the business hours of the company.

Similar to geographic locations, the system includes support tools to locate existing locations in the records. These allow not only the establishment of a given distribution site or only a company at the distribution site, but also the establishment of a new location with a new geographic point and its geocoding.

The Distributor may record attributes, requirements, or restrictions that are supportive when deciding on the shipping plan that the site contains.
