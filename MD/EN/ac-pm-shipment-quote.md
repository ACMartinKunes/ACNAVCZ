# <a name="ac-pm-shipment-quote"></a>Quote

A listing of a potential business case is used to track bids.

Additionally, the quote requires that it be valid, but does not capture the required time for loading and unloading. Within the quote, as with Shipments, you can specify loading and unloading (even more), commodities as items of transport and cost of implementation. Within the quotes you can use the search functions, respectively. copies of existing bids, calculating expected costs based on mileage and times from map data (taking into account the fees M&G provides), using customer price lists, or comparing shipments from historical data.

Upon confirmation of a business case, the quote can be transferred to the mailing list where it becomes a valid order from the customer. If you refuse the quote, you can also cancel the quote with information about the reason for its rejection for a re-evaluation.
