# Bill-to Types

This code list is used to set the types of taxpayers who contribute (either all, or only partially) to pay for spa services. 
Payer type is an attribute that is contained in the customer card -Source Tab. This parameter has an effect on some of the pricing settings (eg. Payers setting services, setting price levels) and posting of sales.
