The evidence of cards used in transport enables the registration according to the types of cards. Implementation includes, for example, fueling cards of various refueling systems, toll processing systems, or SMS cards used to communicate with the vehicle or the driver.

The record tool allows you to lead a time assignment agenda (dispatcher, driver, vehicle, ...) and use the data to process data from external refueling systems or tolls for that vehicle.
