# <a name = "ac-pp-workflow-monitoring-fields.md" > </a> Workflow Monitoring Fields

The Workflow Monitoring Fields add-on module extends the functionality of the Workflow - Status Management module with automatic workflow status changes on the base of the changes in the value of the selected fields in the table.

In the case of changes in the value of the field, the system automatically invokes the before-set action. The set of tracked fields and invoked actions can be set.
