SharePoint Publisher add-on module allows you to publish documents directly from Microsoft Dynamics NAV into a central data store in SharePoint, file system or database of Microsoft Dynamics NAV and link them with records in tables of the information system. The attached documents can be published directly from Microsoft Dynamics NAV to open the associated application. Module so greatly enhances the value of information and the possibility to use the records in the Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Practical use of this technology is the connection of the product information to cards of goods or commercial documents (e.g. contracts) to the suppliers' or the customers' cards.
