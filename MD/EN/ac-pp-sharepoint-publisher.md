Add-on module for SharePoint allows you to Publish directly from within Microsoft Dynamics NAV to publish documents in a central data store for SharePoint, file system, or database in Microsoft Dynamics NAV, and link them with records in tables the information system. The attached documents can be published directly from Microsoft Dynamics NAV to open the associated application. Module so greatly enhances the value of information and the possibility to use the records in the Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Practical use of this technology is the connection of the product information to cards of goods or commercial documents (e.g. contracts) to cards suppliers or of the customers.
