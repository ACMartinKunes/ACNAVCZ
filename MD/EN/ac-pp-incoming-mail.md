# < and name = "ac-pp-incoming-mail.md" > Register </a> Inbox

Add-on module Registration mail allows you to register and manage approval of incoming and outgoing "paper" documents directly in Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Approval takes place in a controlled manner, according to predefined workflow templates for the entire document or for partial the amount of the document (e.g., approval of the costs after the centres). Using the integration with SharePoint Publishing module can be used to connect the electronic post office registered the image, which enables to eliminate the physical circulation of paper documents after the Organization and the related risk of their loss or destruction.
