# ## <a name = "ac-pp-workflow-linker-tables.md" > </a> WorkFlow-Controlled table

The add-on module, Workflow-controlled table extends the functionality of the add-on module for option Workflow checks on records or fields in tables that are bound to a table that is controlled by a workflow.
The State of the workflow is then allowed to change only if all the checks in the context of controlled tables match. Practical use can be, for example, this:

-If the workflow is applied to the document with the header and the lines, for example, on a sales order, you can check whether there are any header rows, or rows of some type or content. For example. the order contains at least one row of the goods, or that it has on all lines vyplněnu price or location or glob. dimension, etc.
-You can check the record source to a field in a table with the workflow contains the necessary data in the other fields. If the document header is filled in the salesperson code field, then checks whether the retailer filled with an email.
