Add-on Central Database allows you to synchronize tables between the different NAV databases and companies. Method (what tables, fields) and  direction of the synchronization are parameterizable in the NAV. The module is designed to synchronize data between different data sources. These may be two companies in one database as well as 2 companies in different databases. The application can also be used to synchronize data with external systems (e.g.. B2B applications, custom applications, specialized manufacturing software, etc.). 
The setting is always the master-client between two companies (databases). For the child, you can enable companies, or disable inserting and editing records in synchronized tables. The synchronization process can be done online at the time the data changes (a change document is generated for corresponding record), according to the user's choice as a comprehensive package of data or synchronized automatically as data package in periodic intervals (by using the Shareplan add-on). Data communication of changes or synchronization is carried out using structured XML documents.
