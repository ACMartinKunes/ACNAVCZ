# Description Setup

Is used to set the use of generic descriptions in different parts of the Spa solution. It is divided into tabs:
-	General
-	Accommodation plan (here set up general descriptions that use the accommodation Plan (a stepladder). The first description in the block, appears directly in the entry, additional descriptions within the same block are shown as hints (when hovering the mouse over the item in the stepladder)
