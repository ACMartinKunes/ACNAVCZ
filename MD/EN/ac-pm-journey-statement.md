These records serve to account for both domestic and foreign business trips of all employees, regardless of whether they were a THP worker's journey or a truck driver's journey. Each employee is kept the balance in the form of operational records.
Part of the bill statement is:

- a record of advance payments made for a business trip, even in multiple currencies,
- recording of all related costs in cash (eg parking, toll, tunnel fees, ...),
- calculation of subsistence allowance.

Pre-reconciliation of individual types of costs allows you to manage the cost of corresponding financial accounts.

Providing advances and final travel billing can be done by cash payment or sent to the bank account of the employee designated for billing from the bill.

The calculation of the subsistence entitlement is made according to the Labor Code based on the time spent in the country. Calculated claim values ​​are available in full detail by days and countries. Calculation of entitlement may be adjusted as appropriate in the sense of recognition or non-recognition of entitlement or taking into account supplements in the form of an increase in subsistence allowance according to the employer's internal guidelines.

Recognizing recognized travel costs is a dimension defined by links to transport records.

Part of the billing process is a printout, which contains details of the advances made, the costs incurred by each type and the final settlement per currency. For each bill, you can also print out the details of a meal entitlement that can be used to document a driver's entitlement.
