# <a name = "ac-pp-notifications.md" > </a> Notifications

Add-on module allows you to manage system notification to data states and processes in Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Notifications works both internally in the system, as well as externally in the form of an e-mail.
The basis for the use of the module is to define the conditions and monitored events in the system, on which it is necessary to notify the user or respond in a particular way. In addition to monitoring current events you can monitor the development of events in time.
