# Time Schedule 

Timesheets are used for the definition of working time. If it is in the context of working time allowed a break will be broken down into several schedule lines according to the breaks that are not recorded in the timesheet. The time schedule is the net working hours so that they can provide the procedure or perform overhead tasks (e.g. cleaning of the work area).
