# Bill-to of Services Setup

Payers setting services defines who will be the payer of medical, accommodation, catering and additional services, treatments, restaurant accounts, fees and phone for a certain combination of the client, the type of stay and the type of payer. The field "number of the main payer" allows you to set up exceptions for specific Bill-to customer. The system first searches for combinations with the completed the payer and then without it.
