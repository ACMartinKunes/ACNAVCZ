The module is designed to handle warehouse operations by warehouse staff using barcode readers. A prerequisite for using is the definition of barcode numbers in a cross-reference table for item cards.

Allows you to perform selected warehouse operations: 
* Simple documents for receiving, picking, transfer between warehouses and inventory (item journals)
* Receipt and issue being created according to the order (sales and purchase order, sales return order, purchase order and order consumption and transfer order)

The whole solution consists of:
* Add-on Warehouse Bartech Barcodes, which provides document handling functionality and operations in Microsoft Dynamics NAV.
* Mobile warehouse clerk UNI that is installed either on a PC, and provides the transfer of data between the Terminal and the storage of data from which subsequently takes over Microsoft Dynamics NAV or in the Terminal, where the reader allows the processed individual warehouse operations
Terminal - is a physical device to a custom implementation of the inventory activities worker in warehouses.
