Commodities are used to register the products that may be the subject of implementation of transport in transport spaces (e.g. pallets, tires, barely...). You can define for each commodity basic unit of measure (UoM), its volume, weight, number of pallets and also, her the categorization. Registration allows conversions to other units of measure.
