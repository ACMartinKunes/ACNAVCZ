Returnable packaging evidence is an extension of the Stocks module. Allows to track the circulation of returnable packaging and pallet management. It is possible to monitor the packaging balloon of business partners with a link to the relevant business transactions (Purchase, Sale, Receipt, Issue, Transfer, Consumption and Production) and to monitor the current price of packaging.
