Trucks inlude all transport spaces. It is a register of semi-trailers, trailers, but also firmly connected transport spaces that are tightly coupled to the vehicle (e.g.. transport the supply of space or covered wagon).

Trucks have a private breakdown according to three independent dials:

- Types
- Categories
- Specifications

They contain, in general, technical, accounting and accounting data.

The Truck Card contains status management, which takes into account the his uptime and usability in the context of the implementation of transport. Basic State management is the same as for cars.
