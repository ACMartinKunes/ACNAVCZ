This registration represents the different variants of the meal broken down by type of food. The food is recorded centrally.  
For each meal you can define whether the thermal processes, whether it must measure the tempera-ture in the processing or remove a sample for the purposes of the relevant reports.
For each eat you can specify the default variant recipe depending on the spa house, local eateries, a type of eating, eating a diet, age category and specify the priority of these dependencies. In the case that when you create a daily diet of variant recipes is not intended, or the selected option, the default option is selected for the food with the highest priority that corresponds to a given combinati-on. 
For food that is produced elsewhere and elsewhere to consume, it is possible to define the default factory Settings of the catering facilities in the table production.
