The complaint module allows you to manually record complaints with a possible link to the shipment, shipment, driver, employee, dispatcher, or vehicle to which the shipment was made. Record complaints can be broken down by type of claims that are user-definable. The module also provides options for recording malicious protocols that may be part of one or more complaints.

Traffic complaint evidence includes status management. The states and their sequence can be defined according to the process used in the processing of complaints. The complaint claims a history of changing the status of the claim.
