# Text Translations

Spa solution allows you to define the translations for the defined fields selected entities. Translations are handled the same way as in the standard NAV. 
User is displayed and define translations for each entity using the button with the name of "Translation" in the Ribbon.
If multiple values for a given entity resolves, the Ribbon will be more buttons for translation.
The button "Translation" can we find for example. at the Spa, where you can define the name of the spa services in several languages. Translations of the spa services are then applied in some of the reports that allow you to print in different languages (for example, a sales receipt).
In addition to translations of standard fields are in the Spa solutions made possible by the General and the accompanying translations of texts, General descriptions.
