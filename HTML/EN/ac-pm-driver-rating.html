<body><h1>AC Promis - Driver Bonus</h1>
<p>An integral part of the freight transport implementation is the motivation of drivers to economically drive and the quality of the work performed, to which transporters use different assessment indicators in individual areas. Vehicle tracking device records (Transics, Webdiservice) are used to evaluate the driving style in relation to the driver who is logged in the vehicle. The driving style of the driver&#39;s ride can be evaluated in several indicators, such as driving without gas in%, the number of brakes while driving.</p>
<p>For each of the monitored indicators, lower and upper limits can be set for the inclusion of values ​​in the three levels of the rating, below the lower limit, between the lower and the upper limit = in the standard, above the upper limit. For each of the levels, the rate in local currency for the kilometers traveled can be determined according to the indicator.</p>
<p>The evaluation of drivers in individual periods (after a month) contains information about kilometers traveled, values ​​in individual indicators in color resolution of the border to which they fall according to the specified level and the total calculated amount in local currency as the driver&#39;s reward for the monitored driving indicators. Depending on the needs of the person responsible for the assessment, it is possible to make a correction of the calculated amount of the claim before payment.</p>
<p>Completing the evaluation period will result in the transfer of amounts to the driver bonus balance, which is used to record the payment of the claim for different types of surcharges. The current driver bonus balance can be viewed from the driver card.</p>
<p>Other evidence of drivers&#39; ratings, such as the performance of prescribed operations during transport, the quality of the implementation or the fuel savings compared to the standard consumption of the vehicle, are not part of the standard solution. Each carrier has its own indicators and evaluation conditions that can be incorporated into the system through customer adjustments.</p>
<p>To record the entitlement to pay the rewards for other ratings, you can use the Driver&#39;s Bonus Logbook. In the case of an agreed data structure, automatic import from a file can be performed for the customer&#39;s needs.</p>
