<body><h1>AC Promis - Integration Plantour</h1>
<p>Integration with Plantour is based on MS SQL exchange tables.</p>
<p>The following 4 tables are exported from the NAV:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vehicles</strong> - Vehicle parameters (12-digit code) are also recorded for comparison with delivery point restrictions (see next point)</li>
<li><strong>Delivery points</strong> - This list is continuously updated from the NAV as they are created on a regular basis on the documents. There are up to 2 time windows for 7 days a week, followed by vehicle restrictions (maximum weight, folding ramp, loading hand, ... this is customer implementation)</li>
<li><strong>Consignments</strong> - there are flows to / from delivery points (commodities but also pallets); Plantour takes care of everything to be done at every moment.</li>
<li><strong>Drivers</strong> - only basic codebook for own drivers Code, name, phone, Active</li>
</ul>
<p>The following 2 tables are imported into the NAV:</p>
<ul>
<li>T_TRS_O - calculated routes</li>
<li>T_ZAST_O - stops on the route</li>
</ul>
<p>The current way of picking shipments to Plantour is done through filters where the field can be used as the first or last distr number. location, required loading / unloading time, planting status, Plantour status. These filters can be used to select delivery shipments at Plantour scheduling, shipments to date, shipments unplanned, shipments not sent to Plantour.</p>
