<body><h1>Client Group Stay</h1>
<p>Register groups in the system represents a <strong>Client Group Stay Card</strong>, which contains all the information about the Group and its requirements. Represents a bit of a simplified form of the card of residence of the client. Groups can be homogeneous and heterogeneous (i.e. in one group of clients can be of different types of care). 
By filling in the expected number of stays automatically creates an appropriate number of individual cards of stays that are bound to that group. Individual stays from the group, then the user assigns to clients and binds them with the relevant requirements of the Group (which are defined in the lines of Cards stay at client group) by using the features on the card.
Accommodation for group stays is reserved to the entire room. </p>
