<body><h1>AC Promis - Accompanying texts</h1>
<p><strong>Accompanying texts</strong> allow you to define and manage the notes of individual entities. They always relate to the entity, that is, they are made to a specific entity and are also deleted with the entity. This is Session 1:N.
They are used as notes and also in reports.</p>
<h3 id="codes-for-using-text">Codes for using text</h3>
<p>Usage codes allow you to scale texts that then connect to different entities.</p>
<p><strong>Setting of accompanying texts</strong> - this is a user-defined dial which determines which entity the accompanying texts will be accessible and with which usage codes. The value in the &quot;Order of Selection&quot; field determines the order in which the usage codes of the accompanying texts will be offered to users within the same entity.</p>
<p>You can select a group of general texts in the &quot;Use a group of texts as a template&quot; to serve as a template for the use of the accompanying text. The user can use this template when entering the accompanying text to the entity, and if necessary, modify it according to the properties of the entity.</p>
<p>Accompanying texts are displayed in the info window of the entity if at least one of the accompanying text is set for the entity in the Cover Text Settings. Clicking on the &quot;Number&quot; field (even in the case of a blank value), the user gets into the contents of the accompanying text. The &quot;Edit Text&quot; button can define the text content for each language code.</p>
<p>If a general text template is set for the use of the accompanying text, the user can use it using the &quot;Use template&quot; action. This translates the text defined in general texts into the content of the accompanying text. User can edit it later.</p>
