<p>For the definition of calendars is better to use &quot;Calendar templates“to be allocated to individual calendars (multiple calendars can have a common template) and by which it is possible to populate the calendar for the next years.
In calendar template shall be the days that will define as a working and each day will be allocated the time schedule (working hours within the day) with the possibility of an even and an odd week resolution. It is also possible to define a special timetable for the holiday, and define the priority position of the feast towards the other days in the week. This means that a holiday can be defined on the basis of the calendar of the special arrangements of working hours than in the other days, and can be defined, what mode is applied when the holiday falls on a Saturday, Sunday or weekday. </p>
