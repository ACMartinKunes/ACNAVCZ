<p>These records serve to account for both domestic and foreign business trips of all employees, regardless of whether they were a THP worker&#39;s journey or a truck driver&#39;s journey. Each employee is kept the balance in the form of operational records.
Part of the bill statement is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a record of advance payments made for a business trip, even in multiple currencies,</li>
<li>recording of all related costs in cash (eg parking, toll, tunnel fees, ...),</li>
<li>calculation of subsistence allowance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-reconciliation of individual types of costs allows you to manage the cost of corresponding financial accounts.</p>
<p>Providing advances and final travel billing can be done by cash payment or sent to the bank account of the employee designated for billing from the bill.</p>
<p>The calculation of the subsistence entitlement is made according to the Labor Code based on the time spent in the country. Calculated claim values ​​are available in full detail by days and countries. Calculation of entitlement may be adjusted as appropriate in the sense of recognition or non-recognition of entitlement or taking into account supplements in the form of an increase in subsistence allowance according to the employer&#39;s internal guidelines.</p>
<p>Recognizing recognized travel costs is a dimension defined by links to transport records.</p>
<p>Part of the billing process is a printout, which contains details of the advances made, the costs incurred by each type and the final settlement per currency. For each bill, you can also print out the details of a meal entitlement that can be used to document a driver&#39;s entitlement.</p>
