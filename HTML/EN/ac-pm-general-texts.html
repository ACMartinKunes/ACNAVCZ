<body><h1>AC Promis - General texts</h1>
<p>General texts allow you to define general text one at a time, and then use it in several places in the system. This is the N:N session. There may be N text for one entity, or 1 text may be used by N entities. They can also serve as a template for accompanying texts. For better clarity, you can divide them into groups. General texts are defined in 1 place, directly in the General texts. They consist of a header (code identification) and language variants of texts. The other entities then only join or serve as a template for the definition of the accompanying text.</p>
<p>They are used as notes and also in reports.</p>
<h3 id="codes-of-use"><strong>Codes of use</strong></h3>
<p>Usage codes allow you to scale texts that then connect to different entities.</p>
<p>General texts are displayed in the Info panel of the given entity if at least one general text use is defined for the entity in <strong>General Text Settings</strong>. Clicking on the &quot;Number&quot; field (even in the case of a blank value) the user gets into the general text content. For a given entity, the user can only select from a defined defined list of general texts and join it to the entity. Can not change the content of general text for the entity.</p>
<p><strong>General text settings</strong> - This is a user-defined codebook that specifies for which entity generic texts will be accessible and with which usage codes. The value in the &quot;Order of Selection&quot; field determines in which order the general text use codes will be offered to users within the same entity.</p>
